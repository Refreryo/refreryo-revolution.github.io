# Support

Need help with our Discord bots? You're in the right place!

## Quick Support

If you're having trouble with one of our bots, here are some quick steps to try:

1. Make sure the bot has the necessary permissions in your server
2. Check that you're using the commands correctly (see our [Command Reference](docs/commands/))
3. Try kicking and re-inviting the bot if it's not responding

## Common Issues

### Bot not responding to commands?

- Ensure the bot is online
- Check if the bot has permission to see and send messages in the channel
- Make sure you're using the correct prefix (Slash commands start with `/`)

### Missing features?

- DinoByte has fewer features than Green Dino by design
- Some features may be disabled by default and need to be enabled
